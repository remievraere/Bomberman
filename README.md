# Bomberman

This game is a bomberman like with GDL (overlay of OpenGL)

## Goal

There is 3 differents game mods, but globally, the goal is always the same you always have to kill the IAs or your opponent.

## Rules

You can control a character and make him move with arrows. You can put bombs on the floor who will explode after a little moment. 
Once you are hit by a bomb (yours or your opponent's) you died, and the game is over. IA have 1 life point like you so they died once they are hit by a bomb too.
A bomb can destroy boxes, and sometimes there is bonuses inside : 
  - Speed up
  - Max bomb putted on the same time up
  - Bomb range up

There is 3 different mods :
  - The free mod allow you to play against as many IAs as you want or against a friend, in the map of your choice (one of your creation thanks to the editor for example)
  - The second mod is the survival mod, you have to kill all the ia to reach the next level until the end.
  - The last one is a survival mod (like zombies) and you have to go as far as posible, each waves have 1 more opponent.
